Fibpredictor results can also be combined with more sophisticated but computationally demanding simulation methods to further refine the initial predicted structures, identify potentially important interactions in amyloid fibrils, study mechanical properties of amyloid fibril	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00894-016-3066-1	Ghomi	2016

To identify new CSF analytes associated with AD, they took a novel approach by developing a quantitative measure of “caseness,” employing the CSF ptau181-Aβ42 ratio as an endophenotype for AD. This status-independent criterion avoids the misclassification of controls and cases,  by improving power, and is a continuous quantitative trait.
