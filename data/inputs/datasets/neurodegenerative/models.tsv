Fibpredictor results can also be combined with more sophisticated but computationally demanding simulation methods to further refine the initial predicted structures, identify potentially important interactions in amyloid fibrils, study mechanical properties of amyloid fibril	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00894-016-3066-1	Ghomi	2016

To identify new CSF analytes associated with AD, they took a novel approach by developing a quantitative measure of âcaseness,â employing the CSF ptau181-AÎ²42 ratio as an endophenotype for AD. This status-independent criterion avoids the misclassification of controls and cases,  by improving power, and is a continuous quantitative trait.

411	AD	Protein aggregation	Biochemical/cell-free assay	Fibrils	Diagnosis of disease	Protein dysfunction: Tau (phosphorylation)	Low-medium/low	Recent research efforts into alternative approaches for AD biomarkers have focused on biomimetic recognition elements such as peptides, molecular imprinting polymers, and nucleic acid aptamers. 	This study demonstrates that the aptamer 3146 could be promising as biorecognition element in the development of aptamer-based biosensors for detecting most of the tau protein isoforms  	10.1016/j.aca.2018.07.029	Lisi	2018
