Field	Field Type	
Model no. 	Number	This number refers to a model of a respiratory disease which is described in a paper. The same paper can describe more than a model.
Disease area	Drop-down list	Upon abstract screening, and again upon full text screening, papers were categorised by disease area, being one of the 5 NDD diseases (PD, AD, FTD, ALS, MS),  or several NDD
Disease feature	Drop-down list	Specific endpoints of the disease with options for " Exploratory/ no specific feature"  and "na". 
Category	Drop-down list	Upon abstract screening, papers were categorised by large groups, and these were revised upon full text evaluation
Type	Drop-down list	More specifications, if applicable,  on the model used.
Application/ aim	Drop-down list	Explanation on main scientific aim, or application of the model/method described.
Biological or disease-specific endpoint	Drop-down list	List of potential biological endpoints, used in a model system to describe either the characteristics of a model, or changes in the model system related to disease feature.
Assay throughput/Content	Drop-down list	If applicable, the models is described in tems of throughput.
Potential	Free text	Possible multile model application in addressing disease features
Relevance	Free text	Biological relevance of the model for the disease feature in replacing animal models
First author	Free text	First author of the paper which describes the model of neurodegenerative disease.
Author	Free text	DOI link, or other links.
Year	Free text	Year of publication of the paper which describes the model of neurodegenerative disease.
