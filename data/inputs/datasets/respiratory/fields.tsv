Field	Field Type	Drop-Down Options	Notes
Model no.	Number	Â NA	This number refers to a model of a respiratory disease which is described in a paper. The same paper can describe more than a model.  
			
			
Disease Area	Drop-down list	For example:	Upon abstract screening, papers were broadly categorised by disease area.

		Pulmonary Fibrosis	
		Cysic Fibrosis	
Disease Feature	Drop-down list	For example:	Specific endpoints of the disease with options for " Exploratory/ no specific feature"  and "na". 
		Elastin Viability	
		Exploratory/ no specific feature	
		Inflammation	
		Protein aggregation

		Tissue/Cell Viability	
		Vasoconstriction	
Category	Drop-down list	For example:	Papers were categorised during the screening phase of abstracts, using the some model types decided upfront.

		Biochemical/cell-free assay	
		Chip or microfluidic system	
		Computational/in silico	
		Human/patient ex-vivo tissue or body fluids	
		Human/patient primary or stem cells	
		Human-derived cell lines	
		Organoid model	
		Other	
Type	Drop-down list	For example:	More specifications, if applicable, on the model used. 
		Human pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells	
		Human Precision-Cut Lung Slices (PCLS)	
		Human samples from Lung Disease Biobank (Germany).

		RPMI2650 cell line	
		A549 cell line	
		HFL-1 cell line	
		Co-culture model (multiple cells)	
		Computational model	
		CSF	
Application	Drop-down list	For example:	Main scientific aim or application of the model. 
		Comparison of barrier integrity	
		Diagnosis of disease	
		Disease mechanism (exp/theor)	
		Disease therapy developm	
		Drug developm/ testing	
		Identification of Biomarkers	
		Mimics lung microenvironment	
		Model development - experim	
		Model development - theoret	
		Model validation	
		Study of lung surfactant	
Biological endpoints	Drop-down list	For example:	List of potential biological endpoints, used in a model system to describe either the characteristics of a model or changes in the model system related to disease feature. 
		Apoptosis	
		Chemotaxis	
		Cytokine Release	
		Gene expression	
		Imaging	
		Immunohistochemistry	
		Infection	
		Inflammatory Mediators
